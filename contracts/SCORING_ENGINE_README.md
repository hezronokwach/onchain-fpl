## 🎯 Scoring Examples

### Example 1: Goalkeeper Performance
**Player**: Alisson (GK)
- 90 minutes played: **2 points**
- 6 saves (2 sets of 3): **2 points**
- Clean sheet: **4 points**
- 1 bonus point: **1 point**
- **Total: 9 points**

### Example 2: Forward Performance (Captain)
**Player**: Haaland (FWD) - Captain
- 90 minutes played: **2 points**
- 2 goals: **8 points** (4 × 2)
- Yellow card: **-1 point**
- **Subtotal: 9 points**
- **Captain bonus: +9 points**
- **Total: 18 points**

### Example 3: Defender Performance
**Player**: Van Dijk (DEF)
- 90 minutes played: **2 points**
- 1 goal: **6 points**
- Clean sheet: **4 points**
- 2 bonus points: **2 points**
- **Total: 14 points**

## 🔄 Auto-Substitution Logic

### Substitution Rules
1. **Goalkeeper**: Automatically substituted if doesn't play
2. **Outfield Players**: Substituted in bench order (1st sub, 2nd sub, 3rd sub)
3. **Formation Maintenance**: Substitutions must maintain valid formation
4. **Playing Time**: Only substitute with players who actually played

### Formation Validation
- Ensures substitutions don't break formation requirements
- Validates position counts match selected formation
- Prevents invalid team compositions

## 🎖️ Captain/Vice-Captain System

### Captain Rules
- **Double Points**: Captain receives double points for all actions
- **Selection**: Must be from starting 11 players
- **Automatic**: No manual intervention required

### Vice-Captain Rules
- **Backup Role**: Only becomes captain if captain doesn't play
- **Single Points**: If captain plays any minutes, vice-captain gets normal points
- **Automatic Activation**: System automatically detects and applies

## 📋 Usage Examples

### Updating Player Performance
```solidity
DataStructures.PlayerPerformance memory performance = DataStructures.PlayerPerformance({
    playerId: 1,
    matchweek: 1,
    goals: 2,
    assists: 1,
    minutesPlayed: 90,
    cleanSheet: false,
    saves: 0,
    cards: 0,
    ownGoal: false,
    penaltyMiss: false,
    bonusPoints: 3,
    isValidated: true
});

scoringEngine.updatePlayerPerformance(1, 1, performance);
```

### Calculating Team Score
```solidity
// Calculate score for user's team in matchweek 1
scoringEngine.calculateTeamScore(1, userAddress);

// Get the calculated score
DataStructures.TeamScore memory score = scoringEngine.getTeamScore(1, userAddress);
console.log("Total points:", score.totalPoints);
console.log("Captain bonus:", score.captainPoints);
console.log("Bench points:", score.benchPoints);
```

### Getting Individual Player Points
```solidity
uint256 points = scoringEngine.calculatePlayerPoints(performance);
console.log("Player earned:", points, "points");
```

## 🔒 Security Features

1. **Access Control**: Only owner can update player performances
2. **Input Validation**: All parameters validated before processing
3. **Reentrancy Protection**: NonReentrant modifier on score calculations
4. **Data Consistency**: Player ID and matchweek validation
5. **Duplicate Prevention**: Cannot calculate same team score twice

## 🎯 Integration Points

The ScoringEngine integrates with:

1. **TeamManager Contract** - Reads team compositions and player data
2. **PoolManager Contract** (Future) - Will use scores for winner determination
3. **Oracle System** (Future) - Will receive player performance data
4. **Frontend Interface** - All view functions available for UI
