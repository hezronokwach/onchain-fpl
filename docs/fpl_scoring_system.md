# Fantasy Premier League (FPL) Scoring System

## Overview

The Fantasy Premier League scoring system rewards players for positive contributions on the pitch while penalizing negative actions. Points are awarded based on player positions, with different point values for goals scored by goalkeepers/defenders versus midfielders and forwards. The system has undergone significant changes for the 2025/26 season, introducing new defensive contribution points and bonus system updates.

## Core Scoring System

*Note: Players must play at least 1 minute to be eligible for any points*

### Goal Scoring Points

|----------------|----------------|
| Goalkeeper | **6 points** |
| Defender | **6 points** |
| Midfielder | **5 points** |

## New Features for 2025/26 Season

### Defensive Contribution Points (NEW)

Starting from the 2025/26 season, outfield players are now rewarded for their defensive contributions with Fantasy points. Defenders earn 2 points when they reach a combined total of 10 clearances, blocks, interceptions and tackles (CBIT) in a single match, while midfielders and forwards need 12 defensive actions to earn the same 2 points.

| Player Position | Defensive Actions Required | Points Awarded |
|----------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| Defenders | **10 CBIT** | **+2 points** |
| Midfielders | **12 CBIT** | **+2 points** |
| Forwards | **12 CBIT** | **+2 points** |

*CBIT = Clearances, Blocks, Interceptions, and Tackles combined*

### Updated Assist Definition (2025/26)

For the 2025/26 season, the definition of a Fantasy assist has been simplified to better recognise players for their contributions. Fantasy assists are often awarded to the player from the goalscoring team who has the final touch before a goal is scored, and they are awarded three FPL points.

## Bonus Points System (BPS)

### How Bonus Points Work

The Bonus Points System (BPS) utilises a range of statistics to create a BPS score for every player. The three best performing players in each match will be awarded bonus points. Three points will be awarded to the highest-scoring player, two to the second best and one to the third.

### Bonus Points Distribution

| Ranking | Bonus Points Awarded |
|---------|---------------------|
| 1st place | **3 bonus points** |
| 2nd place | **2 bonus points** |
| 3rd place | **1 bonus point** |

### Tie-Breaking for Bonus Points

If there are ties in the BPS scores:
- If there is a tie for first place, Players 1 & 2 will receive 3 points each and Player 3 will receive 1 point
- If there is a tie for second place, Player 1 will receive 3 points and Players 2 and 3 will receive 2 points each
- If there is a tie for third place, Player 1 will receive 3 points, Player 2 will receive 2 points, and all tied players for third place will receive 1 point each

### Bonus Points System Changes for 2025/26

#### Goalkeeper Save Updates
A goalkeeper will now earn THREE points in the BPS if the shot was taken from inside the penalty area or TWO points in the BPS if the shot is outside the box. A penalty save will result in a minimal reduction from nine points in the BPS to eight this season.

| Save Type | BPS Points (2025/26) |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Save from inside penalty area | **3 BPS** |
| Save from outside penalty area | **2 BPS** |
| Penalty save | **8 BPS** |

#### Defensive Action Updates
Anyone making a goalline clearance will now earn nine BPS points. That was a mere three last season. Prolific tacklers not only have the opportunity to bag defensive contribution points but also have a better chance of bagging bonus points to go with it.

| Defensive Action | BPS Points (2025/26) |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Goalline clearance | **9 BPS** |
| Successful tackle | **Enhanced points** |

## Implementation Considerations for Smart Contracts

### Data Requirements
- Real-time match data feed
- Player statistics tracking (goals, assists, saves, defensive actions)
- Match duration and substitution information
- Disciplinary records (cards, own goals, penalty misses)
- Bonus Points System calculations

### Oracle Integration Points
- Match completion triggers
- Player performance data validation
- Clean sheet confirmation
- Bonus points calculation and distribution
- Captain/vice-captain point multiplication

### Edge Cases for Development
- Matches abandoned before 60 minutes (no points awarded)
- Players substituted exactly at 60 minutes
- Goalkeepers playing outfield (rare scenarios)
- Technical errors in official data feeds
- Retroactive changes to match statistics
