# EPL Fantasy Miniapp: System Requirements and Execution Plan

## Introduction

The EPL Fantasy Miniapp is a blockchain-based fantasy football application built on Base Layer 2, specifically targeting Kenyan users. Inspired by the official Fantasy Premier League (FPL) system, the app enables players to join weekly pools for each EPL matchweek by paying a fixed entry fee of 50 KSh (approximately 0.00015 ETH via on-ramp conversion).

Key features include:
- **FPL-Style Team Selection**: Players select 15 players with 11 starting, following official FPL formation rules
- **Dynamic Matchweek Structure**: Variable number of matches (3-20) including weekday fixtures and double gameweeks
- **Strict Deadlines**: Team selection closes 1 hour 30 minutes before the earliest match of each matchweek
- **Real-World Performance Integration**: Chainlink oracles fetch EPL player performance data
- **FPL Scoring System**: Points awarded based on official FPL rules (goals, assists, clean sheets, etc.)
- **Winner-Takes-All**: Highest scoring team wins the entire pool
- **Kenyan Focus**: M-Pesa integration for seamless KSh-to-ETH conversion
