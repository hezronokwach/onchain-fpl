# 👥 Implement Team Management Contract - Issue #4

## Summary
Successfully implemented the TeamManager contract for OnChain FPL system with complete team selection, validation, and storage functionality. All FPL rules and constraints are enforced on-chain.

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
- **Player Management**: Owner can add players with position, price, and team data
- **Team Submission**: Users submit teams for matchweeks with full validation
- **Team Modification**: Teams can be updated before pool deadline
- **Captain Selection**: Proper captain and vice-captain designation
- **Deadline Integration**: Uses pool deadlines for submission validation

### FPL Validation Rules
- **Budget Constraint**: ≤ £100M total cost enforced
- **Squad Composition**: Exactly 15 players (2 GK, 5 DEF, 5 MID, 3 FWD)
- **Formation Validation**: Valid FPL formations (3-4-3, 4-3-3, 4-4-2, etc.)
- **Team Limits**: Max 3 players from same EPL team
- **Starting XI**: Exactly 11 players in valid formation
- **No Duplicates**: Each player can only be selected once

### Security & Safety
- **ReentrancyGuard**: Protection against reentrancy attacks
- **Ownable**: Access control for player management
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter validation
- **Deadline Enforcement**: Teams cannot be submitted after deadline
